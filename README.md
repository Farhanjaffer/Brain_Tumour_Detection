# Brain Tumour Detection with Python

## Overview
This repository contains an end-to-end solution for detecting brain tumors using Python. The project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze medical images and identify potential tumors. It aims to assist medical professionals in diagnosing brain-related abnormalities accurately and efficiently.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** The data preprocessing module includes image normalization, resizing, and augmentation techniques to enhance the quality of input images.
- **Model Architecture:** Implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture tailored for medical image analysis. The model is designed to effectively capture intricate patterns and features indicative of brain tumors.
- **Training Pipeline:** The training pipeline includes data loading, model training, validation, and evaluation stages. It supports customization of hyperparameters and offers visualization tools to monitor training progress.
- **Inference Module:** The inference module enables users to perform inference on new brain images. It provides functions for loading pre-trained models and making predictions on single or multiple images.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to assess the performance of the model objectively.
- **Visualization Tools:** Integrated visualization tools to display segmentation masks, overlay predicted regions on input images, and visualize model predictions.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation:** Prepare the dataset by organizing brain MRI images into appropriate directories (e.g., train, validation, test).
2. **Training:** Run the training script to train the model on the provided dataset or your custom dataset. Adjust hyperparameters as needed.
3. **Inference:** Utilize the trained model for inference by loading it into the inference module. Provide input images to generate predictions.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the model using evaluation metrics and visualize the results using the provided visualization tools.
